</div>

<div class="w-full mt-6">
    <p class="font-Karla font-normal text-2xl sm:text-3xl m-2">Welcome to MyCoes! We specialize in providing customized web development services tailored to meet your exact requirements. Throughout the development process, we prioritize transparency and flexibility, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience from beginning to end. Your satisfaction is our ultimate goal.</p>
</div>

<div class="w-full mt-6">
    <p class="font-Karla font-normal text-2xl sm:text-3xl m-2">&square; MyCoes is a solopreneur business that excels in developing websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Python, Django, and MySQL. We are proficient in solving both frontend and backend-related challenges. Additionally, we have expanded our offerings to include website design and hosting on AWS.</p>
</div>


<div class="w-full mt-6">
    <p class="font-Karla font-normal text-2xl sm:text-3xl m-2">&square; Rather than setting fixed prices for our services, we prefer to engage in direct discussions with our clients. We encourage you to reach out to us to discuss your specific needs, projects, and any issues you may be facing. Once both parties agree on the pricing, clients can initiate the process by filling out a Development form. We've included a progress bar to keep you updated on the project's status, as well as an additional changes form for requesting further modifications.</p>
</div>


<div class="w-full mt-6">
    <p class="font-Karla font-normal text-2xl sm:text-3xl m-2">&square; For your convenience, we recommend using WhatsApp as our primary contact method, as it offers efficient and streamlined communication. However, we understand that clients may prefer different platforms, such as Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or others, and we are happy to accommodate your preferences. You can also reach us directly via the chat icon on our website, which functions similarly to WhatsApp for your convenience.</p>
</div>

<div class="w-full mt-6">
    <p class="font-Karla font-normal text-2xl sm:text-3xl m-2">&square; If your project involves code, once it's completed, we will notify you and provide a payment page. You can then proceed to make the payment, which should match the agreed-upon offer. Once payment is received, you will receive a downloadable link, allowing you to access and download the project folder. If your project pertains to website hosting, we utilize various platforms. While we haven't yet incorporated separate design and hosting services into our standard offerings, we are open to discussing these aspects separately based on your specific requirements.</p>
</div>

<div class="w-full mt-6">
    <p class="font-Karla font-normal text-2xl sm:text-3xl m-2">&square; We have chosen Stripe as our payment gateway to facilitate secure and convenient transactions.</p>
